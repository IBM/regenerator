## Contributing In General
ReGenerator welcomes external contributions. If you have an itch, please feel free to scratch it.

To contribute code or documentation, please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/ibm/regenerator/pulls).

## Legal

All source files will be covered under the [BSD 2-clause license found here](https://github.com/ibm/regenerator/blob/main/LICENSE).

We have tried to make it as easy as possible to make contributions. This applies to how we handle the legal aspects of contribution. We use the same approach - the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/DCO1.1.txt) - that the LinuxÂ® Kernel [community](https://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin) uses to manage code contributions.

We simply ask that when submitting a patch for review, the developer must include a sign-off statement in the commit message.

Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the submitter accepts the DCO:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your local git repository using the following command:

```
git commit -s
```
